    * Official successor of Undetected Chromedriver
    * Can be made to work for for all chromium based browsers.
    * Dropped selenium and chromedriver binary requirements.
    * fully asynchronous == bizarre performance gains, and more granular control

    Part of undetected-chromedriver, or merely the successor of it, this library is a full rewrite, providing a
    fast framework for web automation, webscraping, bots and any other creative ideas which are normally
    hindered by annoying anti bot systems like Captcha / CloudFlare / Imperva / hCaptcha and other
    big corp "ai" money machines using your input to make even more $$ (http://tinyurl.com/bigcorp-ai-inputs)

    The webdriver/selenium requirement is dropped entirely, since this library communicates directly to the browser.
    Being fully asynchronous, this adds massive performance improvements and more detailed control possibilities.

    As usual ( like undetected chromedriver) all config details and best practices are built-in, which means
    up and running with just a line of code.

    This makes it simple to use for quick prototyping, and perfect for interactive interpreter use (eg: IPython).


    WARNING:
       - results may vary due to many factors. No guarantees are given whatsoever.
       - Running from bad IP or datacenter may still cause captcha's and/or other problems.
       - With great power comes ... etc etc etc
         no but SERIOUS: for your own benefit, make sure "they" have no reason for upscaling anti-bot measurements.
         there might be one day it would not be feasible anymore to work up against big corp, and provide upgrades
         and free libraries.
